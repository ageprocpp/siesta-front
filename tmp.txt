I had trouble setting the background-color of an AppBar element and figured out it's because of a Paper element that I was using with the AppBar element. I usually use Google Chrome, but I also see this trouble in Safari.

The source code is below.

## Current Behavior ðŸ˜¯

I can't set the color of the AppBar element because the css settings for MuiPaper-root class overrides the color setting of the AppBar element. Background-color for MuiPaper-root class was set by using an Paper element.

## Expected Behavior ðŸ¤”

The background-color of the AppBar should be set by using 'color' attribute.
